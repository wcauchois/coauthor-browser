Setup Instructions for Windows
==============================

 - First, you'll need to install Eclipse <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>
   and TortoiseHg (http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/), if you haven't already done so.
 
 - Now navigate to the folder where you keep your source code and create a new
   directory called "coauthor-browser". Right click on the directory and select
   "Clone..." from the TortoiseHg context menu. For the source path, put
   "https://coauthor-browser.googlecode.com/hg/". Click the Clone button to transfer
   files from the Google Code repository. You won't be prompted for authentication yet.
 
 - Now launch Eclipse, and I'm going to assume you've set your workspace directory
   to be the folder where you put coauthor-browser (mine is C:\Users\Billy\Code).
   Select File -> New -> Java Project.
 
 - For the project name, put "coauthor-browser". Eclipse will automatically
   import the source code from the folder you created. Click next and make sure
   everything looks OK, then click finish.
 
 - Now you should be ready to rock & roll! Open Program.java from the package
   explorer (under cs.washington.edu.cse403d.uiprototype) and hit
   Alt+Shit+X,J to run it.
 
Notes on Using Mercurial
========================

 - SET YOUR USERNAME!! In the TortoiseHg context menu, click Global Settings and
   set your username in the "Commit" section. It should be something like
   "Real Name <email.address@gmail.com>".
   
 - REMEMBER TO SYNCHRONIZE with the remote repository. Select "Synchronize..."
   from the context menu.
   
   * Pull - pull changes from the remote repository. After pulling, remember to
     UPDATE your working copy, or changes won't be reflected on the filesystem.
   * Incoming - previews what would happen if you performed a pull operation.
   * Push - push your commits to the remote repository.
   * Outgoing - previews what would happen if you performed a push operation.
