	<h3>Results Page</h3>
	<p class="backLink"><a href="index.html">&raquo; Back to Getting Started</a></p>
	<p>Once you have run a search, there are three types of results pages you 
			could get: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Author Search Results</li>
		<li>Multiple-Author Search Results</li>
		<li>Article Search Results</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Author Search Results</h4>
	<p>The Author Search Results Page is split up into two parts:
	<ol>
		<li>Co-Authors</li>
		<li>Publications</li>
	</ol>
	
	The Co-Authors list will include all of the co-authors the given author has 
	collaborated with.  With this list, you can either double click on a new authors
	name to run a new search, or right click on their name for more options.
	
	More options:
	<ol>
		<li>Run a new search for that authors name instead of the given author.</li>
		<li>Add this author to the search and run a Multiple-Author Search of this
				author along with the given one.</li>
		<li>Copy the authors name to your computer's clipboard so that you can paste
				it anywhere else you would like.</li>
	</ol>
	
	</p>
	
	<h4>Multiple-Author Search Results</h4>
	<p>There are two types of Multiple-Author Search Results Page.
	<ol>
		<li>Collaboration Search Page</li>
		<li>Co-author Chain Search Page</li>
	</ol>
	
	Collaboration Search Page is returned when more than three author names have been
	searched together, or there exists a collaboration between two authors.
	
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Collaboration Search Page is divided up into three parts:	
	<ol>
		<li>Author</li>
		<li>Co-authors</li>
		<li>List of Collaborations</li>
	</ol>
	You can click on author or co-author labels to get a new author result page on the chosen entry.
	The interaction with the collaboration list is very similar to that of publication list.
	
	<br/>

	Co-author Chain Search Page is divided up into three parts:
	<ol>
		<li>First Author</li>
		<li>Second Author</li>
		<li>The "chain" of authors from the first author to the second author</li>
	</ol>
	You can click on author or co-author labels to get a new author result page on the chosen entry.
	The interaction with the chain list is very similar to that of co-author list. You can also click on the visualize buton
	to get a visual representation of the chain.
