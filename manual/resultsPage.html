	<h3>Results Page</h3>
	<p class="backLink"><a href="index.html">&raquo; Back to Getting Started</a></p>
	<p>Once you have run a search, there are three types of results pages you 
			could get: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Author Search Results</li>
		<li>Multiple-Author Search Results</li>
		<li>Article Search Results</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Author Search Results</h4>
	<p>The Author Search Results Page is split up into two parts:
	<ol>
		<li>Co-Authors</li>
		<li>Publications</li>
	</ol>
	
	The Co-Authors list will include all of the co-authors the given author has 
	collaborated with.  With this list, you can either double click on a new authors
	name to run a new search, or right click on their name for more options.
	
	More options:
	<ol>
		<li>Run a new search for that authors name instead of the given author.</li>
		<li>Add this author to the search and run a Multiple-Author Search of this
				author along with the given one.</li>
		<li>Copy the authors name to your computer's clipboard so that you can paste
				it anywhere else you would like.</li>
	</ol>
